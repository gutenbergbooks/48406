picture, which is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, was
exposed to neutrons in a nuclear reactor and then placed in contact
with modern photographic film. The original, which had been taken by
William Henry Fox Talbot who began his career in 1834, is badly faded.</p>

<p>You are a physicist investigating the properties of
semiconductors, which are materials used to make transistors.
The electrical properties of one specimen are not quite like
the others that you&rsquo;ve studied. What makes this specimen
different?</p>
<p class="center">OR</p>
<p>You are a physician treating a patient who, because of a
severe calcium deficiency, has been suffering from osteoporosis
(a softening of the bones). Are you on the right track
with your treatment?</p>
<p class="center">OR</p>
<p>You are an analytical chemist working for a plastics
manufacturer. You have been asked by the plant superintendent
to determine why some of the plastic coming from the
plant has been discolored.</p>
<p class="center">OR</p>
<p>You are a curator working with the ancient coin
collection in a large museum. A donor has just given the
museum a group of 50 gold coins presumably about 1500
years old. Are they genuine?</p>
<p class="center">OR</p>
<p>You are a scientist working in the criminology laboratory
of a large metropolitan city. A detective brings you a minute
sample of paint taken from the clothing of a hit-and-run
victim. He has a suspect whose automobile paint seems to
match that sample. Can you determine his guilt or innocence?</p>
<p>Neutron activation analysis can be used to solve each of
these problems and many more. The solutions to these
particular problems are explained on pages <a href="#Page_19">19</a>-46.</p>

<h1 title="">The Atomic Fingerprint:
<br />Neutron Activation Analysis
<br />by Bernard Keisch</h1>
<h2 id="c2">WHAT IS NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS?</h2>
<p>To understand neutron activation analysis, you should be
acquainted with a few basic concepts. The nuclei of atoms
are stable only when they contain certain numbers of
neutrons and protons. The number of protons in an atom&rsquo;s
nucleus determines an element&rsquo;s identity; the number of
neutrons usually determines whether or not that atom is
radioactive or nonradioactive (stable).<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Thus, while all sodium atoms contain 11 protons, only
those sodium atoms that contain 12 neutrons are stable. A
radioactive sodium atom contains a different number of
neutrons. For other elements, there may be more than one
number of neutrons that results in stability; for instance,
there are 10 stable atoms (isotopes) of tin, each containing a
different number of neutrons in their nuclei.</p>
<p>The fact that nuclei can absorb additional neutrons,
which, in many cases, results in the conversion of a stable
nucleus to a radioactive one, makes neutron activation
analysis possible. Because radioactive nuclei decay in unique
ways and yield radiations that are often distinct and can be
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
measured even in very small amounts, measurements of these
radiations can determine the kind and the number of
radioactive atoms that are present.</p>
<p>In the most common type of activation analysis, the
neutron bombardment of a sample is performed in a nuclear
reactor where the neutrons that strike the target atoms have
been slowed down so that they have very little energy of
motion. In this case, the usual reaction between the target
atoms and a neutron results in the capture of the neutron and
this creates a nucleus with an atomic weight of one more unit
than it started with. Thus for sodium as found in nature
(symbol &sup2;&sup3;Na)</p>
<p class="center">sodium-23 + a neutron &rarr; radioactive sodium-24 + gamma rays<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The numbers denote the atomic weight of the atom, which is
the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus.</p>
<p>In a nuclear reactor, there are many, many neutrons that
can be used in this reaction; approximately 10&sup1;&sup2; to 10&sup1;&#8308;
(10&sup1;&sup2; is a million million; 10&sup1;&#8308; is a hundred times 10&sup1;&sup2;)
pass through each square centimeter of target area every
second. Not all these will strike the nuclei of sodium atoms.
Of those that do, not all will be captured. A mathematical
relationship that tells how many atoms of sodium-24 will be
created in a cubic centimeter of the target in one second is:</p>
<p class="center">N&#8322;&#8324; = N&#8322;&#8323;&phi;&sigma;t</p>
<p>where N&#8322;&#8324; is the number of sodium-24 atoms created during
each second in a cubic centimeter of the target; N&#8322;&#8323; is the
number of atoms of sodium-23 in a cubic centimeter of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
target; &phi; is the number of neutrons crossing a square
centimeter per second (called the neutron flux); t is the time
in seconds that the target is in the reactor; and &sigma; is a number
that represents the probability that the conversion of
sodium-23 to sodium-24 will occur. This last number is called
a &ldquo;cross section&rdquo; and it is expressed in &ldquo;barns&rdquo;. One barn is
equal to 10<sup>-24</sup> square centimeter, which is approximately the
cross-sectional area of a typical atomic nucleus.</p>
<p>In an activation analysis experiment, the analyst wants to
determine the number of target atoms (N&#8322;&#8323; in the above
example). He can measure how long the target was in the
nuclear reactor; there are ways of measuring the neutron
flux, &phi;; and the cross section is fixed and generally known for
each target nucleus. So, by measuring the number of
radioactive atoms created (N&#8322;&#8324;), he can calculate the number
of target atoms. See the <a href="#pic_3">figure on the next two pages</a>.</p>
<p>Actually, to get the most accurate results, there are
certain practical tricks he can use that increase the accuracy.
Some of these will become apparent in later sections of this
booklet.</p>
<p>The most important of these &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; is the use of a
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;comparator&rdquo;. This comparator is similar in
form and composition to the sample to be measured but
contains a <i>known</i> quantity of the element to be determined.
The steps used for the analysis are simple.</p>
<p>1. Put the sample and comparator together into a reactor
and bombard them with neutrons.</p>
<p>2. Remove them and measure the radioactivity produced
from the sample.</p>
<p>3. Compare the radioactivity of the sample and the

<h2 id="c3">THE SENSITIVITY<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> OF NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS</h2>
<p>There are several factors that determine the sensitivity of
the method. Some are variable within limits and some, like
the cross section, are fixed. Time is variable to a degree,
partially determined by the half-life of the nuclide created
and with an upper practical limit determined by how long we
want to wait for an analysis.</p>
<p>The crucial step in the analytical procedure is the
measurement of the number of radioactive atoms that were
created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. How do we measure how many radioactive atoms
are present?</p>
<p>2. Since there will usually be a mixture of elements in
a target, and many of these will be made radioactive, how
can we tell one from another?</p>
<p>3. Since radioactive atoms are constantly &ldquo;disappearing&rdquo;
by radioactive decay, how do we obtain the number
of atoms created from a measurement made some time
after the bombardment has taken place? And what of
those atoms disintegrating while others are still being
created in the reactor?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Radioactive atoms almost always decay by emitting
negatively charged beta particles usually accompanied by
gamma rays. Instruments can detect these kinds of radiation,
and it is by measuring the radiation that we determine how
many radioactive atoms are present. To do this we have to
know the types of radiation emitted by the radioactive atoms
we are trying to measure. Fortunately each kind of radioactive
atom decays with a unique &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; scientists call a
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
&ldquo;decay scheme&rdquo;. The <a href="#pic_8">figure on the next page</a> shows a simplified
decay scheme for manganese-56, which is produced by
activation of manganese, and a diagram showing what the decay
scheme means.</p>
<p>Until a few years ago, it was difficult to measure the
number of gamma rays of a particular energy that were being
emitted by a mixture of radioactive isotopes unless there
were only a few such gamma rays with very different
energies. Today instruments are available that can really pick
them out of a complex mixture. Thus it is usually possible to
&ldquo;separate&rdquo; with electronic instruments the radioactive element
we are interested in measuring. Some of the examples
below will show how this might be accomplished.</p>
<p>Each radioactive nuclide<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> also has a characteristic half-life,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
which is a measure of how fast the radioactive atoms
change (transmute) to atoms of another element. In a
reactor, even while they are being produced in the target,
atoms of the radioactive nuclide are decaying with the
particular half-life of the nuclide. The mathematical laws that
govern this process tell us that the number of atoms
determines the amount of decay; i.e., the more atoms there
are, the greater the amount of decay in a given period of
time. (The fraction that decays in that time is constant.) As a
result, the target eventually becomes &ldquo;saturated&rdquo;, that is, the
rate of production equals the rate of decay. When the
irradiation is first begun, the number of radioactive atoms
increases steadily. But eventually, this rate of increase slows
down until, at saturation, further irradiation no longer
increases the number of radioactive atoms present in the
target.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_8">

</div>
<p class="icaption">An <span class="norm">energy level diagram</span>. The slanted arrows indicate radioactive decay
by beta-particle emission. In each case, manganese-56 decays to a
certain energy level of iron-56. On the right the energy of each level is
indicated. Following a beta emission to a high-energy (excited) state in
iron-56, one or more gamma rays are emitted until the nucleus is
de-excited to the level marked zero. The vertical arrows indicate gamma
rays emitted during the de-excitation process. The energy of each
gamma ray is the difference between the levels involved in the change.
The numbers above the vertical arrows indicate the relative proportions
of gamma rays of different energies emitted from that level.</p>
<p class="tb">The mathematical relationship that describes the irradiation
process exactly is:</p>
<p class="center">A&#8320; = N&phi;&sigma; (1 - e<sup>-&lambda;t</sup>)</p>
<p>where A&#8320; is the radioactivity produced (disintegrations per
cubic centimeter per second); N is the number of target
atoms per cubic centimeter in the sample; &phi; is the neutron
flux (neutrons per square centimeter per second); &sigma; is the
cross section for the reaction (square centimeters); &lambda; is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
disintegration constant<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
for the radioactive atoms produced
(number per second); the number &ldquo;e&rdquo; is the base of natural
logarithms; and t is the irradiation time in seconds. Note that
for short irradiation times (t very small), 1-e<sup>-&lambda;t</sup> approximates
&lambda;t, while for long irradiations (t very large), 1-e<sup>-&lambda;t</sup>
approximates 1.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_9">

</div>
<p class="icaption">This summarizes what the decay scheme or energy level diagram shows
in terms of the relative amounts of betas and gammas emitted in the
decay of manganese-56. Thus, you could observe more than three times
as many gamma rays having an energy of 0.847 MeV than of
1.811 MeV, etc. Note that while one, and only one, beta is emitted in
the decay of one atom of manganese-56, two gammas can sometimes be
emitted in one decay.</p>
<p>Of course, when the target is removed from the reactor,
the number of radioactive atoms begins to decrease according
to the characteristic half-life of the nuclide. The mathematical
expression that describes the process of radioactive
decay of a single nuclide is:</p>
<div class="center">A<sub>t</sub> = A&#8320;e<sup>-&lambda;t</sup></div>
<p>where A<sub>t</sub> is the radioactivity of an isotope at some time, t,
after the end of the irradiation, and A&#8320; is the radioactivity at
the end of the irradiation.</p>

15 hours. The horizontal line marked 1.0 represents the &ldquo;saturation&rdquo;

sample is within 1% of the value at saturation, which is the most active
that sample will ever become at a given &phi;. Note also that after the first
15 hours (1 half-life) the sample is exactly half way to its value at
saturation. Thus long irradiations are useful to increase the sensitivity
of the analysis, but only up to a certain point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The result of all this is that the sensitivity of an analysis
depends in practice on a number of practical as well as
theoretical factors:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. The cross section of the target element.</dt>
<dt>2. The half-life of the radioactive isotope produced.</dt>
<dt>3. The time available for irradiation.</dt>
<dt>4. The flux of neutrons available for irradiation.</dt>
<dt>5. The promptness with which we can begin measuring radioactivity and the efficiency of this measurement.</dt>
<dt>6. Possible interferences due to the presence of elements yielding the same radioactive elements or those yielding very similar radiations.</dt></dl>
<p>In the next section of this booklet, there are several
examples that will show you how all this works in practice.
But to summarize what these factors mean in terms of
sensitivity let us look at the chart in the <a href="#pic_12">figure on page 18</a>.
Here all the elements are arranged in a periodic table. The
sensitivities are shaded in coded ranges representing measurable
quantities. They are calculated on the basis that there are
no interferences, that the neutron flux is 10&sup1;&#8308; neutrons per
square centimeter per second, and that we can measure 100
gamma rays per minute without much difficulty assuming a
gamma-ray detector efficiency<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> of 10%. The elements labeled
&beta; yield radioisotopes that emit few or no gamma rays and can
only be analyzed by neutron activation using appropriate
chemical separation procedures followed by beta radioactivity
measurements. Such chemical separation procedures
(to remove unwanted radioactive isotopes of other elements)
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
are also sometimes useful to improve the sensitivity of the
analysis of gamma-ray emitters if necessary.</p>

<p class="icaption">The radioactive decay curve of sodium-24. The vertical scale is not
<span class="norm">linear</span> but <span class="norm">logarithmic</span>. Thus, each factor of two in radioactivity
occupies the same distance along the vertical axis. When two samples
are being analyzed for sodium by activation analysis, they must be
compared at the same time after they have been removed from the
neutron flux. If this period of time is different, then a correction must
be applied to one of them, based on the decay curve shown here, to
allow for the difference in decay time for the two. Waiting too long
after the irradiation is completed results in much poorer sensitivity for
the analysis depending on the half-life of the activation product. In this
case, after 2 days it takes approximately ten times as much sodium to
yield the same radioactivity as it would if the sample were measured
when it was fresh out of the reactor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>It is not practical to determine a few elements, shown in
black squares, by activation analysis. Some others, like
oxygen and nitrogen (labeled HE), can be measured by using
other projectiles like fast (more energetic) neutrons, or
protons or deuterons<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> produced in a device called an
accelerator. Other elements, those shown in white squares,
can be detected with such great sensitivity, that one can find
some in almost everything. For example, if you had a cube of
&ldquo;pure&rdquo; aluminum only 1 millimeter on a side, you could
detect gold in it if there were only one atom of gold for every
fifty billion atoms of aluminum.</p>
<p>While it isn&rsquo;t often that you would want to find a gold
needle in an aluminum haystack, the next section presents
some practical applications. Imagine yourself as the person

<h2 id="c4">HOW AND WHERE TO USE IT</h2>
<h3 id="c5">In a Physics Laboratory</h3>
<h4><i>The Problem</i></h4>
<p>You are a physicist investigating the properties of
semiconductors, which are materials used to make transistors.
When you apply a voltage to one specimen of silicon (a
semiconductor), it doesn&rsquo;t behave quite like the others that
you&rsquo;ve studied. The electrical properties of this odd specimen
are unusual and interesting and could lead to a new type of
transistor. What makes this specimen different from the
others? Very small amounts of impurities can cause large
changes in the electrical properties of semiconductors. You
would like to obtain a chemical analysis of the material, but
your colleagues in chemistry tell you they would have to
dissolve a good size part of your sample to analyze it and you
are reluctant to give it up. How do you do it?</p>
<h4><i>The Solution</i></h4>
<p>You decide to try neutron activation analysis. You realize
you won&rsquo;t be able to detect all the elements, but many of
those that might affect semiconductor performance could be
detected quite easily.</p>
<p>What will you need? A source of neutrons to activate the
material and a gamma-ray spectrometer to measure the
radiation from the material afterwards. This spectrometer
detects and measures gamma rays and sorts them according
to their energy. You find that your friend down the hall, who
is a nuclear physicist, has a gamma-ray spectrometer that
incorporates a lithium-drifted germanium crystal as a detector
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
and a pulse height analyzer. The germanium detector is a
device that senses the gamma rays that enter it and gives
electrical signals related to the energy of the gamma rays. It
was invented only a few years ago and has a very fine
resolution. That is, it can easily &ldquo;pick out&rdquo; gamma rays that
are only slightly different in energy. For example, for gamma
rays with energies of approximately 1 MeV (million electron
volts), it is not unusual to distinguish between gamma rays
that differ by only 2 or 3 tenths of a percent. The pulse
height analyzer is an electronic device that sorts the electrical
pulses from the detector according to their energy.</p>

container is a reservoir of liquid nitrogen that keeps the detector cooled
to a temperature of -196&deg; Centigrade (321&deg; below zero, Fahrenheit).
The lead brick shield keeps out most of the gamma rays that come from
naturally radioactive materials in the room. The plastic slots hold cards
upon which the samples are mounted for counting. Sometimes the
detector is arranged vertically and samples are placed on shelves above
it.</p>

</div>
<p>What about the neutrons for the irradiation? Although there isn&rsquo;t a
suitable nuclear reactor<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> in your city, there is
one at a university only an hour away by jet. Since it may
take a few hours to get the sample to the counter after
irradiation, you won&rsquo;t be able to look for short-lived
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
activation products, i.e., those with half-lives of up to an
hour. However, this will exclude only a few elements from
detection.</p>

spectrum is displayed on the television screen. Data is printed out

graph on the paper to the left. In other systems, data may be coded
onto punched paper tape as well. Such tape may be &ldquo;read&rdquo; by a
computer that can be programmed to use the data to calculate what
radioactive isotopes are present and their quantities.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to begin the analysis. This will be a
qualitative analysis since you are merely looking for a
significantly different element in that silicon crystal. How
much of it is present is only of secondary interest. Therefore,
if you find anything different, you will rely on an approximate
calculation to tell you &ldquo;how much&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="icaption">This is called a &ldquo;swimming pool&rdquo; reactor because the nuclear fuel, built
into metal rods, is held in a framework at the bottom of a deep pool of
water. The water serves as a shield to protect workers from the
radiation and also helps the reactor &ldquo;go&rdquo; by slowing down neutrons to
make them more likely to interact with the target atoms. &ldquo;Swimming
pool&rdquo; reactors are frequently used for neutron activation analysis and
typically provide neutron fluxes of over 10&sup1;&sup3; (10 million million)
neutrons per square centimeter per second.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_17">

</div>
<p class="icaption">These sealed quartz capsules contain samples to be irradiated in a
nuclear reactor. They are about to be placed in the aluminum can,
which will be sealed and positioned at the end of an aluminum pole,
close to the core of a &ldquo;swimming pool&rdquo; reactor. Often samples are
placed in plastic tubes and are carried in and out of a reactor by air
pressure in a pneumatic tube system.</p>
<p>You carefully scrape off a small amount of material,
weigh it on a sensitive balance, and put it into a short piece
of pure quartz tubing. You do the same with an ordinary
piece of silicon for comparison and then seal both tubes with
an oxygen-gas torch. Although the tubes are both &frac14; inch in
diameter and about 1 inch long, the first tube is just slightly
longer so you will be able to determine which is which after
the irradiation.</p>
<p>Off it goes to the reactor in a carefully wrapped package
along with instructions to irradiate the tubes for 12 hours in
a neutron flux of about 10&sup1;&sup3; neutrons per square centimeter
per second and to return them as quickly as possible after
they are removed from the reactor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The following week, the samples are delivered about
4 hours after they were removed from the reactor. Working
quickly but carefully, you note that they are radioactive but
easily handled by ordinary laboratory techniques. You break
the quartz tubes one at a time and attach each of the two
pieces of silicon to a card with self-sticking tape. Then you
place each card, in turn, on a holder close to the gamma-ray
detector for a period of 10 minutes. A spectrum, which is a
graph of the quantity of radiation recorded in each increment
of energy over the range observed for each of the samples, is
plotted automatically at the end of the counting period and
you may now compare the compositions of the two samples.
(See the <a href="#pic_18">figure on the next two pages</a>.)</p>
<p>The two spectra are virtually identical except that the
suspect sample has one obviously different peak in channel
157 and a somewhat smaller peak in channel 183. Referring
to an energy calibration curve for the pulse height analyzer,
you find that these channels correspond to 0.559 and
0.657 MeV respectively. A search of a table of nuclides,
arranged by gamma-ray energy, reveals that this combination
is emitted by arsenic-76, which would be the activation
product for arsenic. Other data also indicate that for arsenic
there should be a number of smaller peaks, including some
corresponding to energies of 1.216, 1.228, 0.624, and
1.441 MeV. A closer look at the spectrum of the suspect
sample reveals that these are also present.</p>
<p>Finally, noting that the half-life of arsenic-76 is approximately
27 hours, you wait a day and count the sample again
in the same position as the previous count. A decrease in the
heights of the 0.559 and 0.657 MeV peaks, by a little less
than half in 24 hours, confirms that arsenic is the unusual
element in this sample. It may not be the only impurity
causing the peculiar behavior of this semiconductor, but it
does seem a likely candidate.</p>

<p>Using the equation given on <a href="#Page_12">page 12</a>, the approximate
known values for half-life, sample weight, neutron flux, and
periods of irradiation and decay after irradiation, and an
estimated value for the number of arsenic-76 atoms measured
by the gamma-ray spectrometer, you calculate that the
arsenic content of the sample is approximately 44 parts per
million (ppm). (See appendix.)</p>
<p>With this information as a starting point, you are now
ready to proceed with further research on the properties of
your semiconductor, e.g., if you double the concentration of
arsenic, how will that affect its properties?</p>
<h3 id="c6">In a Hospital</h3>
<h4><i>The Problem</i></h4>
<p>You are a physician treating a patient who, because of a
severe calcium deficiency, has been suffering from osteoporosis
(a softening of the bones). You think you are on the
right track with your treatment, but you would like to be
sure in order to know whether you should continue the
treatment or try something else. You would have your
answer if you knew that the calcium content of his skeleton
had stopped decreasing. How can you determine the amount
of calcium in a living human being?</p>
<h4><i>The Solution</i></h4>
<p>You know that the usual techniques for determining
calcium in the bones are not very useful. They are either too
inaccurate to show that your patient&rsquo;s calcium loss has been
stopped or can only be used to measure the calcium content
of the bones in his extremities. The latter is not satisfactory
because these few bones may not be representative of the rest
of his skeleton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Recently, however, there have been reports of neutron
activation analysis of whole persons, in which the calcium
content of their bones has been measured with unusually
good reliability. This has been accomplished by scientists and
doctors working at the University of Washington School of
Medicine in Seattle.</p>
<p>You manage to obtain an appointment for your patient
and you accompany him to the hospital for the analysis.
There he is placed on a rotating platform with his head
encircled by a plastic helmet and his arms and legs submerged
in a water-filled plastic container. See the
<a href="#pic_20">photograph on the next page</a>.
The platform is located in a beam of neutrons
emanating from a beryllium target 15 feet away, which is
being bombarded by deuterons from a 22-MeV cyclotron.
The purpose of the water is to surround the bones in that
part of the subject&rsquo;s skeleton with a neutron moderator
equivalent to the body tissue surrounding the rest of his
skeleton. (A neutron moderator slows down the neutrons and
thus makes them more likely to activate the calcium in the
bones.) On each side of the patient, there are two plastic
containers permanently filled with a solution containing a
known quantity of calcium. These serve as standards for the
analysis.</p>
<p>The beam of neutrons is turned on for 35 to 40 seconds.
It is then interrupted while platform and patient are rotated
180 degrees. The irradiation is resumed so that a uniform
dose of neutrons bombards the patient from both front and
back.</p>
<p>During the irradiation your patient receives a dose of
radiation equivalent to approximately 10 ordinary chest X
rays and one of the calcium isotopes in his bones (calcium-48)
is activated to calcium-49. The latter has a half-life of
only 8.8 minutes and so counting must begin soon after the
irradiation.</p>

<p class="icaption">A patient in position for whole-body gamma-ray spectrometry. The
detectors are scintillation crystals that produce pulses of light proportional
in intensity to the energy of the gamma ray absorbed in the
crystal. The patient is scanned from head to foot in approximately 12&frac12;
minutes at a rate that is varied to compensate for the gradual decay of
the calcium-49 radioactivity during this period. Near the patient&rsquo;s head
are two calcium standard solutions in plexiglas containers.</p>
<p>The patient lies down in a padded aluminum box and,
only 4 minutes after the irradiation is concluded, a ring of 4
gamma-ray scintillation detectors<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> begin to measure the
gamma rays emitted by his body. These detectors, which are
each 4 inches thick and 9&#8540; inches in diameter, pass over his
body from head to foot. This takes 12&frac12; minutes and since
the calcium-49 is decaying with a half-life of 8.8 minutes, the
detectors are made to scan at a gradually decreasing rate to
compensate for the reduced radioactivity during the later
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
parts of the counting period. The <a href="#pic_22">figure on the next page</a>
shows the gamma-ray spectrum for the patient. Notice the
peak corresponding to an energy of 3.1 MeV. Because there
are small contributions to this energy peak from other
activated products in the body, repeat counts are taken later
(after the calcium-49 has decayed) so that these contributions
can be measured and subtracted.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes after the irradiation period, the radioactivity
of the calcium standards is measured by the same
instrument. The ratio of the counts from your patient&rsquo;s body
to that of the standards is 0.210; this serves as an index of
the calcium content of his body on this day. Because of the
care taken to make the analysis repeatable, this index is
probably accurate to about 1 or 2%.</p>
<p>Your patient&rsquo;s disease usually results in a decrease of
approximately 3% of the calcium in his body per year. Thus,
by making the same measurement a year from now, you will
be able to tell if your treatment is a success by noting that
the calcium level in your patient&rsquo;s bones has stopped
decreasing at a dangerous rate.</p>
<h3 id="c7">In a Plastics Plant</h3>
<h4><i>The Problem</i></h4>
<p>You are an analytical chemist working for a company
that makes plastic. It is 11:30 a.m. and you have been called
by the plant superintendent because some of the plastic
coming from the plant has been showing a yellowish-brown
discoloration. There seem to be only a few possible reasons
for it, but no easy way to tell which one is correct. One
possibility is that a copper tank, in which the plastic is
prepared, is somehow being corroded by excess acid in the
raw material and minute quantities of dissolved copper are
discoloring the plastic. You could prove that this is the cause
if you could find copper in the plastic, but the plant
superintendent wants the answer immediately because a few
hours delay in production will jeopardize a valuable contract,
and ordinary chemical analysis would take several hours.
How can you quickly determine if there is copper present in
the plastic?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_22">
<img src="images/pg018.jpg" alt="Graph: &ldquo;Counts per 12.5 minutes/50 KeV channel&rdquo; _vs_ &ldquo;Channel no.&rdquo;" width="500" height="571" />
</div>
<p class="icaption">A portion of the gamma-ray spectrum obtained after neutron activation
of a human body. The area in the 3.10-MeV peak, which is above the
background due to sodium and chlorine activities, is a measure of the
quantity of calcium in the body of the subject. A computer may make
the necessary corrections due to the background (which results from
overlapping of part of the other gamma-ray peaks).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h4><i>The Solution</i></h4>
<p>One reason that ordinary analytical methods are so slow,
in this case, is because the amount of copper you are looking
for is so small that you would have to dissolve a large amount
of plastic to get enough copper to measure. You know that
nearly all the plastic is carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and
that none of these elements are easily made radioactive when
they are bombarded with low-energy neutrons. You look in a
table to see if copper is easily activated. You find that there
are two stable isotopes of copper having atomic weights of 63
and 65. Each of these is easily activated, giving radioactive
isotopes, copper-64 and copper-66. The latter has a half-life
of about 5 minutes and emits gamma rays with energies of
1.039 MeV, which are easy to measure.</p>
<p>In the research building next door, there is a small reactor
that can irradiate encapsulated samples with low-energy
neutrons at the rate of a million million neutrons per square
centimeter per second (10&sup1;&sup2; neutrons/cm&sup2;/sec). You calculate
that if you irradiate only one tenth of a gram of the
plastic for 10 minutes, and if the plastic contains only one
part of copper in one million parts of plastic, then at the end
of the irradiation the radioactive copper formed will be
emitting over 400 gamma rays per second. There is a
pneumatic tube that can remove the irradiated sample in
20 seconds, and you decide that it will take only a minute or
two to remove the sample from its capsule and get it into a
gamma-ray counter located nearby. The counter is a scintillation
counter that is connected to a pulse-height analyzer.</p>
<p>If you count for only 10 minutes you will detect about
1000 gamma rays of the right energy (allowing for the
inefficiencies of the detector system). This sounds like it
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
should do the job. But does the good plastic contain copper
too? And how much does it take to produce the discoloration?</p>
<p>You decide to use neutron activation analysis and to
analyze samples of faulty plastic, normal plastic, and a small
piece of copper foil, which you have weighed and sealed in a
small polyethylene bag as a standard. Your results are shown
in the table below.</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><th>Sample </th><th class="r">Counts in 10 minutes<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></th></tr>
<tr><td class="l">0.1 grams faulty plastic </td><td class="r">100,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">0.1 grams good plastic </td><td class="r">1,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">0.1 milligrams of pure copper </td><td class="r">1,000,000</td></tr>
</table>
<p>It worked! The faulty plastic contains 100 times as much
copper as the good plastic, specifically 100 parts per million.
(If 0.1 milligrams of pure copper gave 1,000,000 counts, then
the 0.1 grams of faulty plastic contains
(100,000/1,000,000) &middot; 0.1 milligrams or 0.01 milligrams of
copper. This is one ten thousandth of the weight of the
plastic or 0.01% or 100 ppm.) You relay the information to
the plant superintendent almost before he finishes his lunch.
He now knows what to do and the crisis is over.</p>
<h3 id="c8">In a Museum</h3>
<h4><i>The Problem</i></h4>
<p>You are a curator working with the ancient coin
collection of a large museum. A donor has just given the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
museum a group of 50 gold coins presumably about
1500 years old. After months of careful study, you have
satisfied yourself that most of those coins are genuine
specimens of that period. Judging from your experience, you
decide that a small group of five are definite forgeries.</p>
<p>However, there are three others that you suspect are also
fakes, but you are not quite certain. You know that both
genuine minters and forgers often tried to save money by
diluting their gold with less expensive metals such as silver
and copper. Since the chances are slim that the forger&rsquo;s
product has the same concentration of gold, silver, and
copper as the genuine coins, you realize that a chemical
analysis would help you decide if the doubtful pieces were
real or fake.</p>
<p>An accurate chemical analysis would require a sample of
such size that the coin would be ruined as a museum
specimen. You need an analytical method that can be applied
to an infinitesimal sample.</p>
<h4><i>The Solution</i></h4>
<p>You are not a scientist but you&rsquo;ve heard about neutron
activation analysis. Therefore, you contact a radiochemist at
a local university who is an expert in this field.</p>
<p>He decides to use a sampling technique developed by
scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory for sampling
metal objects of archaeological interest. You obtain from him
a set of 50 quartz plates that have been ground on one side.
Following his instructions, you carefully scrape away a small
area on the edge of each coin. You then rub each freshly
cleaned area across the ground surface of one plate leaving a
minute streak of metal similar to a pencil mark.</p>
<p>At the scientist&rsquo;s laboratory, each plate is carefully placed
inside a quartz tube. No attempt is made to weigh the tiny
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
streak of metal since you wish only to compare the ratios of
the metal concentrations. However, because the samples
make a rather bulky package, the scientist is concerned with
the uniformity of the neutron flux that each sample will
&ldquo;see&rdquo;. He therefore also places in each tube an exactly equal
weight of a gold&mdash;silver&mdash;copper alloy wire (of known
proportions) to act as a standard neutron-flux monitor. The
tubes are then sealed and taken to a reactor to be irradiated
for 12 hours.</p>
<p>After the samples are removed from the reactor, the
scientist carefully breaks open each of the quartz tubes and
places the sample and the standard piece of wire in separate
numbered plastic capsules with lids. For an accurate comparison,
each capsule is prepared in the same manner. About
4 hours after the samples are removed from the reactor, he
begins the radioactivity measurements.</p>
<p>The sample capsules are loaded into an automatic
sample-changing mechanism that places each one into an
identical position above a lithium-drifted germanium detector.
(See the chapter beginning on <a href="#Page_19">page 19</a>.) Gamma-ray
spectra are collected all day, first from a sample, then from
its accompanying standard. Each count takes 2 minutes, and
3 minutes are required between counts for data printout and
sample changing. A typical gamma-ray spectrum looks like
the one in the <a href="#pic_23">figure on the next page</a>. Notice that only gold
(gold-198) and copper (copper-64) show up in this short
counting time. Later on, radioactivity from silver (silver-110<i>m</i>)
can be measured using a longer counting time. This
can be done because while the activation products from
copper and gold have relatively short half-lives (12.8 hours
and 2.7 days, respectively), that from silver has a half-life of
270 days. To increase the sensitivity of the analysis for silver,
the scientist repackages and re-irradiates the samples and
wires for 100 hours. Silver-110<i>m</i> is one of <i>two</i> radioactive
isotopes of silver that have the <i>same</i> mass. In this case, one
has a higher energy than the other and decays in a different
way. This is known as an isomeric state and it occurs for
many other elements as well as for silver.</p>

<p class="icaption">The spectrum obtained from a streak of metal on a quartz plate after a

</div>
<p class="icaption">The spectrum obtained from the same streak of metal after re-exposure
to neutrons for 100 hours and a delay of approximately 2 months
before counting. Activation products from gold and copper have
decayed away and the gamma-ray spectrum of silver-110m is now
observed. In this case the sample is closer to the detector than for the
earlier measurement and the measurement takes 100 minutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Two months later, the scientist repeats the procedure of
counting the samples and standards, except that this time the
plastic capsules are closer to the detector, each count is for
100 minutes, and the sample changer operates for about a
week. A typical spectrum looks like that in the <a href="#pic_24">figure on page 39</a>.</p>
<p>The scientist can now compute ratios for the three
elements in each sample and compare them with the
standard, but he decides that a computer could do it faster
and with fewer errors. The data collected during the two
series of counts are therefore sent to a data processing center
where, in a matter of minutes, a computer does the following
for each of 50 samples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Finds the 0.411-MeV gamma-ray peak for gold-198.</p>
<p>2. Determines the total counts in the peak.</p>
<p>3. Repeats the process for the corresponding wire
standard.</p>
<p>4. Corrects the total count for the wire for the small
amount of radioactive decay that occurred in the few
minutes between the sample count and the standard
count.</p>
<p>5. Computes the ratio: [total count for sample/total
count for standard (corrected)]</p>
<p>6. Repeats all the above for the 0.511-MeV gamma
ray for copper-64 and (in the longer counts) for the
0.658-MeV gamma ray for silver-110.</p>
<p>7. Computes the ratios: [sample to standard (for
copper)/sample to standard (for gold)] and [sample to
standard (for silver)/sample to standard (for gold)].</p>
<p>8. Tabulates and prints the ratios found in Step 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_25">
<img src="images/pg022.jpg" alt="Graph: Number of coins at indicated ratios vs. Copper/gold ratio" width="500" height="359" />
</div>
<p class="icaption">Radioactivity ratios for 50 &ldquo;gold&rdquo; coins. Above are the silver to gold
ratios. There are two groups of genuine coins. Five known forgeries
show considerably higher ratios than the genuine coins. Two of the
suspect coins also show high ratios but the third, suspect A, shows a
ratio that falls into one of the genuine groups. Below are the copper to
gold ratios. Again there are two groups of genuine coins. (The same
coins make up the two groups here as above.) The five known forgeries
again show higher ratios than the genuine ones and again the same two
suspects appear to be forgeries. Suspect A, however, shows a ratio
similar to one group of the genuine specimens. One therefore concludes
that suspect A is genuine and that B and C are not.</p>
<p>For example, suppose for <i>sample 1</i> there are 20,000 counts
in the 0.412-MeV peak (gold), 190 counts in the 0.511-MeV
peak (copper), and 450 counts in the 0.654-MeV peak
(silver). Suppose also that <i>standard 1</i> yielded 10,000, 500,
and 400 counts for these three peaks (corrected for decay),
respectively. Then the ratio for gold would be
(20,000/10,000) = 2.00, the ratio for copper would be
(190/500) = 0.380, and the ratio for silver would be
(450/400) = 1.13.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Finally, the activity ratio of copper to gold would be
(0.380/2.00) = 0.190, and the activity ratio of silver to gold
would be (1.13/2.00) = 0.565.</p>
<p>Because each sample was irradiated with an identical
standard, and counted in an identical arrangement, the last
two ratios will be the same for different samples if, and only
if, the concentrations of gold, silver, and copper in those
samples are in identical proportions. This will be true no
matter where in the reactor or for how long the irradiation
took place.</p>
<p>Now the scientist presents the data to you. You
immediately see that (a) the good coins fall into two groups,
one with a silver to gold activity ratio of approximately 0.56
and a copper to gold ratio of approximately 0.20 and a
second group with these ratios approximately 0.51 and 0.18;
(b) the coins you were certain were forgeries have distinctly
higher ratios ranging from 0.60 to 0.65 for silver to gold and
from 0.23 to 0.30 for copper to gold; and (c) of the three
suspected coins, two have ratios that fall into the range of the
known forgeries, but one, with ratios of 0.552 and 0.198, is
probably genuine.</p>
<p>You present the result to the museum director in the
form of a graph (see the <a href="#pic_25">figure on page 41</a>) and a few weeks
later, 43 coins are added to the permanent exhibits of the
museum, while 7 are discarded.</p>
<h3 id="c9">In a Criminology Laboratory</h3>
<h4><i>The Problem</i></h4>
<p>You are a scientist working in the criminology laboratory
of a large metropolitan city. A detective brings you a minute
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
sample of paint taken from the clothing of a hit-and-run
victim. He has a suspect whose automobile paint seems to
match that sample. The suspect was found in his parked
automobile, not far from the scene of the accident. He seems
to fit the description given by two witnesses, and he is
extremely nervous. You scrape a small sample of paint from a
recently damaged area of the suspect&rsquo;s car, and, (with the aid
of a microscope) find that the pigment content seems to be
the same as that taken from the victim&rsquo;s clothing. But, are
they really from the same paint?</p>
<h4><i>The Solution</i></h4>
<p>You know that paint, like almost everything else,
contains very small quantities of impurities that are present
only by accident and do not affect its properties as a useful
material. The trace impurities, as they are called, will vary
from batch to batch of the same paint. Very rarely will a
match be obtained in both type and concentration of trace
impurities in two samples if they are not from the same
batch.</p>
<p>By measuring a sufficient number of different elements,
the probability of accidentally matching two samples can be
as rare as the duplication of fingerprints in two individuals.
Matching of trace impurities is often called a &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo;
method.</p>
<p>With neutron activation analysis, you can obtain the
&ldquo;fingerprints&rdquo; of the two samples to see if they match.
Although this kind of evidence may be difficult to use as
proof in court, a positive match will let the detective know
that he is on the right track. Also, the suspect might confess
if he is confronted with the evidence and realizes that he is
&ldquo;caught&rdquo;. On the other hand, a mismatch will clear the
suspect completely and the detective will know to look
elsewhere for the criminal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>You seal each sample in a tiny polyethylene bag about &frac12;
inch square. One sample is taken from the victim&rsquo;s clothing
and the second, about the same size as the first, taken from
the damaged area of the automobile. In preparing these
samples, you handle all the materials with clean forceps
because you realize that the most minute dirt from your
fingers will be detected in the analysis.</p>
<p>The two bags are irradiated together for 1 hour in a
nearby reactor and 2 hours later you begin counting the
samples with a high-resolution, lithium-drifted-germanium,
gamma-ray spectrometer. This will give you a match (or
mismatch) for elements that yield radioisotopes of fairly
short half-life such as manganese (2.56 hours), copper
(12.8 hours), sodium (15 hours), arsenic (27.7 hours), etc.
You plan on &ldquo;counting&rdquo; the samples again later on, if the
first counts match, so that you can check on radioisotopes
with longer half-lives such as iron (45 days), chromium
(27 days), silver (270 days), cobalt (5 years), etc.</p>
<p>The two gamma-ray spectra you obtain look like those in
the <a href="#pic_26">figure on the opposite page</a>. The gamma rays from the
irradiated paint taken from the victim&rsquo;s clothing indicate the
presence of the common elements sodium, potassium, and
copper, but gold, lanthanum, and europium are also conspicuously
present. The gamma rays from the other sample also
reveal sodium, potassium, and gold but in rather different
proportions. More striking is the absence of copper and the
two rare earths, and the presence of manganese and arsenic,
which were not indicated in the first sample.</p>
<p>The paint samples definitely do not match. Therefore,
you inform the detective that his suspect is innocent after all.
You&rsquo;ve solved your problem, but he still has his. Perhaps the
same technique will provide positive proof when he finds the
real culprit.</p>

<h2 id="c10">SUMMING UP: WHAT LIES AHEAD</h2>
<p>These five situations are intended to show why neutron
activation analysis is used, when it can be applied, and how it
works.</p>
<p>In the real world, there are often many reasons <i>why</i> this
kind of analysis is used. As in the situations described here, it
may be the only workable method. Sometimes there may be
a choice of methods, but activation analysis is used because it
has certain peculiar advantages or because it happens to be
the most convenient. There are other times, however, when
other analytical methods can and should be used. Such
situations arise when the element sought is not easily
activated, or when a satisfactory alternative method exists
that is more economical or more convenient. The points to
remember about the use of activation analysis are that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. In many cases, no elaborate sample preparation
procedure is required.</p>
<p>2. For many elements, it is the most sensitive
analytical technique known.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The diversity of <i>applications</i> in which activation analysis
is used is enormous and will probably continue to be. The
examples given here represent only a tiny fraction of
circumstances in which the method has been used. Consider
that it has been used successfully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. In the microscopic world of biology and medicine;</p>
<p>2. For meteorites arriving from the vast reaches of
space;</p>
<p>3. In the production lines of consumer products;</p>
<p>4. For precious samples of moon rocks;</p>
<p>5. In the most &ldquo;down-to-earth&rdquo; business of hunting
for new mineral sources;</p>
<p>6. For exploring the causes of Napoleon&rsquo;s death nearly
150 years earlier (see <a href="#pic_28">photograph on next page</a>). Today,
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
there is virtually no field of science and technology that
is untouched by this method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The illustrations of <i>procedures</i> used in the situations
described in this booklet are typical of some in use today.
There are many other situations that require still other
techniques. One of the most exciting, which will be used with
increasing frequency in the future, involves the use of
computers. It has been shown that data collected by
high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometers can be &ldquo;fed&rdquo; directly
to a computer. The computer can be programmed to
identify unknown components and to determine the concentrations
of elements of interest to the analyst. It is entirely
possible to include corrections for radioactive decay, possible
interferences from other elements present, and many other
factors. It appears quite likely that the kinds of analyses
described here (as well as others) may someday be accomplished
automatically, with far smaller chances for error and
probably more economically.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_28">
<img src="images/pg025.jpg" alt="Hair sample" width="500" height="411" />
</div>
<p class="icaption">Samples of Napoleon&rsquo;s hair. Neutron activation analysis of these hairs
revealed that he had been poisoned with arsenic. (He died, however, not
from arsenic poisoning, but from acute mercury intoxication.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Other newer techniques that may find increased usage in
the future are exemplified by the method for activation
analysis of the whole human body. The use of neutrons
produced by nuclear machines (such as cyclotrons or other
particle accelerators) or produced by compact, portable
isotopic sources will make neutron activation analysis even
more versatile. Isotopic sources produce neutrons as the
result of a nuclear reaction. One such reaction uses alpha
particles emitted by polonium-210 (or some other alpha
emitter) to bombard the element beryllium. A different kind
of isotopic source is the man-made radioisotope californium-252
that decays by fissioning (splitting) spontaneously and
produces neutrons in the process. (One milligram of californium-252
will spontaneously produce over 10&#8313; neutrons per
second.) While californium-252 is quite expensive at present,
it is likely that production costs will be significantly reduced
in the future.</p>
<p>With computers, more convenient radiation sources, and
continuing improvements in the technology of gamma-ray
detectors and nuclear electronics, neutron activation analysis
will become more and more a routine tool of the analyst.</p>

<p>Calculation of arsenic concentration with no standard for
comparison.</p>
<p>1. Determination of arsenic-76 activity produced from

<div class="center">A&#8320; = N&phi;&sigma; (1 - e<sup>-&lambda;t</sup>)</div>
<p>where N is the number of target atoms. (One microgram of

6.02 &times; 10&sup2;&sup3; atoms per mole which is 8 &times; 10&sup1;&#8309; atoms of arsenic.)</p>
<p>&phi; is the neutron flux. (This would be known to the
reactor operator. It is usually measured by inserting materials
of known composition and measuring their activation. In this
case, &phi; = 10&sup1;&sup3; neutrons per square centimeter per second.)</p>
<p>&sigma; is the activation cross section. (Neutron cross sections
have been measured and tabulated by scientists. For the
activation of arsenic-75 to arsenic-76, the cross section is
known to be 4.2 &times; 10<sup>-24</sup> square centimeter.)</p>
<p>&lambda; is the disintegration constant for arsenic-76. (Here,
&lambda; = (ln 2<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>/t<sub>&frac12;</sub>,(in hours); t<sub>&frac12;</sub>, the half-life for arsenic-76, is
26.6 hours so &lambda; = (0.693/26.6) = 0.026.)</p>
<p>t is the time of the irradiation. (Here t is 12 hours.)</p>

<p>We use the equation:</p>
<div class="center">A&#8321; = <table class="inline"><tr><td class="num">R</td></tr><tr><td class="den">E&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;F</td></tr></table> e<sup>&lambda;t</sup></div>
<p>where R is the measured count rate. (In this case, R is the
number of counts per second observed in the 0.559-MeV
gamma-ray peak, which is 5300 counts in 20 minutes or 4.4
counts per second.)</p>
<p>E is the efficiency of the detector. (In this case, it is the
number of counts observed in the 0.559 peak for each
0.559-MeV gamma ray emitted by a radioactive material at
the sample distance. This is known for the detector being
used by making other measurements and, for the set-up used
here, is 0.010.)</p>
<p>F is the average number of 0.559-MeV gamma rays
emitted in each disintegration of arsenic-76. (This can be
deduced from the decay scheme of arsenic-76. See the
<a href="#pic_9">decay scheme for manganese-56 on page 13</a>.
In the decay of
arsenic-76 the number of 0.559-MeV gamma rays emitted per
disintegration is approximately 0.41.)</p>
<p>&lambda; is the disintegration constant for arsenic-76. (0.026, see <a href="#Page_49">page 49</a>.)</p>
<p>t is the decay time. (This is the number of hours from the
time the sample was removed from the reactor to the time it
was counted, or 5 hours.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Therefore, A&#8321;, the activity of arsenic-76 produced in the
sample at the time of removal from the reactor,</p>
<div class="center">= <table class="inline"><tr><td class="num">4.4&nbsp;counts&nbsp;per&nbsp;second</td></tr><tr><td class="den">0.010&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;0.41</td></tr></table> e<sup>0.026 &times; 5 hours</sup></div>
<div class="center">= 1200 disintegrations per second</div>
<p>3. Calculation of arsenic concentration in the sample.</p>
<p>We use the equation:</p>
<div class="center">Concentration in parts per million = <table class="inline"><tr><td class="num">A&#8321;</td></tr><tr><td class="den">A&#8320;&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;W</td></tr></table> 10&#8310;</div>
<p>where A&#8321; and A&#8320; were determined above and W is the weight
of sample analyzed or 300 micrograms (0.0003 gram).</p>
<p>Therefore the concentration is</p>
<div class="center"><table class="inline"><tr><td class="num">1200</td></tr><tr><td class="den">9&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10&#8308;&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;300</td></tr></table> &times; 10&#8310; = 44 parts per million.</div>

<h2 id="c15">A word about ERDA....</h2>
<p>The mission of the U. S. Energy Research &amp; Development Administration
(ERDA) is to develop all energy sources, to make the Nation
basically self-sufficient in energy, and to protect public health and
welfare and the environment. ERDA programs are divided into six
major categories:</p>
<p>&middot; CONSERVATION OF ENERGY&mdash;More efficient use of existing
energy sources, development of alternate fuels and engines for
automobiles to reduce dependence on petroleum, and elimination of
wasteful habits of energy consumption.</p>
<p>&middot; FOSSIL ENERGY&mdash;Expansion of coal production and the
development of technologies for converting coal to synthetic gas and
liquid fuels, improvement of oil drilling methods and of techniques for
converting shale deposits to usable oil.</p>
<p>&middot; SOLAR, GEOTHERMAL, AND ADVANCED ENERGY
SYSTEMS&mdash;Research on solar energy to heat, cool, and eventually
electrify buildings, on conversion of underground heat sources to gas
and electricity, and on fusion reactors for the generation of electricity.</p>
<p>&middot; ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY&mdash;Investigation of health,
safety, and environmental effects of the development of energy
technologies, and research on management of wastes from energy
production.</p>
<p>&middot; NUCLEAR ENERGY&mdash;Expanding medical, industrial and research
applications and upgrading reactor technologies for the generation
of electricity, particularly using the breeder concept.</p>
<p>&middot; NATIONAL SECURITY&mdash;Production and administration of
nuclear materials serving both civilian and military needs.</p>
<p>ERDA programs are carried out by contract and cooperation with
industry, university communities, and other government agencies. For
